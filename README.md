### Running the Server

Before using the Business Cards Website, you also need to run the server application.

1. Navigate to the server folder using the terminal or command prompt.

   ```
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages for the server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server by running:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

The server will be up and running, enabling the website to communicate with the server for user authentication and business card management.
